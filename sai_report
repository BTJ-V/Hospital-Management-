The appendix is a small, tube-like organ attached to the first part of the large intestine. 
It is located in the lower right part of the abdomen. It has no known function. A blockage inside of the appendix causes 
appendicitis. The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation.
