A fracture is a break, usually in a bone. If the broken bone punctures the skin, it is called an open or compound fracture. 
Fractures commonly happen because of car accidents, falls, or sports injuries. Other causes are low bone density and 
osteoporosis, which cause weakening of the bones. Overuse can cause stress fractures, which are very small cracks in the bone.
