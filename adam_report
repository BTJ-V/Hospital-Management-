A kidney stone is a solid piece of material that forms in the kidney from substances in the urine. It may be as small as 
a grain of sand or as large as a pearl. Most kidney stones pass out of the body without help from a doctor. But sometimes a stone will 
not go away. It may get stuck in the urinary tract, block the flow of urine and cause great pain.
